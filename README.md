Freechain
=========


Summary
-------

During the last years many blockchains have emerged for record keeping as it came clear the bitcoin blockchain will never be able to host financial transactions and data records both. Most of these blockchains are touted for business use cases by well funded startups. The value of their tokens are fluctuating heavily on exchanges due to speculative frenzy. This in turn makes the use of these blockchains less user-friendly as the future costs of using them is hard to predict.

It is important to understand that no blockchain can exist without a token to charge the users to put data on that blockchain. But it is possible to minimize the speculative attractiveness of such a token. The token has effectively to be de-monetized. This means the token shall not resemble a (digital) currency anymore. Freechain will have a token which will differ in the following ways from most other blockchain tokens to prevent speculation:
•	It is not possible to transfer the token from one address to another (except fees which are collected by the miner).
•	Tokens held by an address longer than 1’000’000 Blocks (approximately 2 years; target block time is 1 minute) will not be spendable and essentially worthless even if present in the blockchain.
•	Every new block mined must send the earnings (miner reward and transaction fees) to new addresses not used before. This is the only way to generate new addresses in the blockchain.
•	An address can never be topped up.
•	The mining reward is increasing over time. This will prevent speculative mining. Users should mine tokens only shortly before they need them to store data on the blockchain.
Freechain is open source and aims to be fully decentralized. Especially the mining of Freechain shall be decentralized as the points above encourage each user to mine his own token needs.

The representation of physical and virtual objects (“coloured coins”) is possible with Freechain. A syntax proposal is given in chapter  7 below. Certain aspects which have to be considered when using Freechain to represent physical and virtual objects are discussed. 

It should be clear that by sacrificing the token transmittal feature of transactions, certain use cases will not be possible with Freechain. Remittances, smart contracts or decentralized applications based on smart contracts are not foreseen to be implemented. For these features the use of existing blockchains such as bitcoin and ethereum are recommended. However it is possible to store code in a transaction which can be executed by anybody using a suitable interpreter or compiler.
